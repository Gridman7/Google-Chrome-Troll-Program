1. Put the "Google Chrome.bat" Program on the desktop and disguise at as google Chrome to the best of your ability
(Make a shortcut to C:\Users\(insert username here)\Desktop\Google Chrome.bat and change the icon to the Google Chrome icon 
to hide it better)
2. Put it in place of Google Chrome and hide the real Chrome somewhere else.
3. Wait until your friend/victim foolishly clicks on your troll program thinking that it is just Google Chrome
4. Watch their reaction when they close the browser
